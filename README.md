Cornea Transplant Surgery- Procedure, Cost and Recovery
Corneal transplantation, also known as keratoplasty, is a surgical procedure performed to replace a damaged or diseased cornea with a healthy one from a donor. This blog provides an overview of corneal transplantation, including its cost, procedures, and when it is necessary.
The need for a corneal transplant arises when the cornea becomes damaged, leading to impaired vision. Some common conditions that may require a corneal transplant include extensive corneal scarring, sores or ulcers in the eyes, Fuch's dystrophy, corneal edema or swelling, tearing or thinning of the cornea, and keratoconus.
There are three main types of corneal transplants performed in India: full-thickness corneal transplantation, partial-thickness corneal transplantation, and endothelial keratoplasty. The choice of procedure depends on factors such as the patient's age, eye condition, ability to care for the eye post-surgery, and cost.
The recovery period after a corneal transplant varies depending on the type of transplant. It is crucial to follow post-operative care instructions, which may include avoiding rubbing the eyes, wearing protective eyewear, using prescribed eye drops, and refraining from certain activities until cleared by the surgeon.
The cost of corneal transplantation depends on various factors, including the patient's age, type of surgery, consultation fees, medications, post-surgery follow-up care, and vision correction. In India, corneal transplant costs are comparatively affordable, making it an attractive destination for medical tourism.
